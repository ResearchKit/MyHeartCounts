    <p style="padding-top:15px;">This study gives you the option to share your data in 2 ways:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Share broadly with qualified researchers:</strong> You can choose to share your coded study data with qualified researchers worldwide for use in this research and beyond.  Coded study data are data that do not include personal information such as your name or email. Qualified researchers will need to meet certain criteria established by university and agree to use the data in an ethical manner for research purposes.</p>
    <p><strong>Share with university researchers and its partners only:</strong> You can choose to share your study data only with university and its partners. This means that your study data will not be made available to other researchers beyond university and its research partners.</p>
    
    
    <p>The results of this research study may be presented at research conferences or in publications. If the results of this study are made public, only coded study data will be used (that is, your personal information will not be disclosed). Results will never be published in a way that would allow data to be associated with individual users.<br/>You can change the data sharing setting though the app preferences at anytime.</p>
